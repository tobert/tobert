# tobert - my stuff

My dotfiles &amp; tools to push them around. Supports Linux (Debian & Arch) and Windows WSL (Debian).

My code is Apache 2. Take what you like, pay it forward :)

# Directories

## cmd

This is where the code for any commands I write in Go live.

## bin

Everything in this directory gets pushed out to my `~/bin` which is in my `$PATH`.

## scripts

Scripts I run less frequently and don't want or need in my $PATH.

## dotfiles

This is intended to be synchronized as-is to $HOME and contains configs for various apps.

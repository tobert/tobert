=head1 NAME

cl-rolling-restart.pl - reboot a cluster as safely as possible

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This script attempts to reboot a cluster safely. It steps through the host
list serially, rebooting one node at a time and only progresses to the next
node if the previous node comes back online. It is quite verbose on purpose,
with the intent of being run in a screen session and left alone for many hours
or days to do its thing.

ICMP is used to determine basic network availability. No node is considered
actually available unless a command can be run over ssh.

Most failures are fatal.  Large clusters will typically have a few nodes down
at any given time, so those nodes are skipped if they fail an ICMP test.

When a run fails, a new list will be written to your ~/.dsh that only contains
the incomplete list, allowing you to resume easily. The name of the file and
the correct command for resuming will be printed.

 cl-rolling-restart.pl --list foo [--timeout 1800] [--wait 60]
      --timeout: number of seconds before giving up on a host
	  --wait: number of seconds to wait between reboots

);

if ($opt_help) {
    pod2usage();
}

=item ping()

Ping the host once, waiting 3 seconds for a response. Returns
1 (true) on success and undef (false) on failure.

This function should move to DshPerlHostLoop at some point.

 ping($hostname);

=cut

sub ping {
    my $hostname = shift;

	my $pid = open3(my $w, my $r, my $e, '/bin/ping', '-c', '1', '-W', '3', $hostname);

	waitpid($pid, 0);

    if ($? != 0) {
		return undef;
    }

	return 1;
}

=item reboot()

SSHes in to the host and issues 'sudo reboot'. The return value is
any text printed by the reboot command, but this should not be used
to determine if it was successful.

 reboot($hostname);

=cut

sub reboot {
    my $host = shift;
    my @out = ssh("$remote_user\@$host", "sudo reboot");
	return @out;
}

=item fail()

Writes out the incomplete hosts to a new host list, prints some information,
then exits immediately with a return code of 1.

 fail(@hostlist, $index); # will exit

=cut

sub fail {
	my($hostlist, $i) = @_;
	my $now = time;

	# print out a machine list containing only the hosts that failed
	# to make resuming the reboot more convenient
	open(my $fh, "> $ENV{HOME}/.dsh/machines.reboot-failed-$now");
	for (1; $i<@$hostlist; $i++) {
		print $fh "$hostlist->[$i]\n";
	}
	close $fh;

	print "\nA machine list containing only the un-rebooted nodes has been written to:\n";
	print "$ENV{HOME}/.dsh/machines.reboot-failed-$now\n";
	print "To resume:\n";
	print "cl-rolling-reboot.pl --list reboot-failed-$now\n\n";

}

=item main()

Try really hard to reboot machines without accidentally taking down more than one
node at a time.

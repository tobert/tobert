# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal dotfiles repository containing shell configurations and terminal customization tools.

## Directory Structure

```
/
└── bin/           # various scripts
└── dotfiles/      # various application configs
└── botdocs/       # various markdown docs generated by bots
```

## Notes

- Theme for terminal things is "Amy's Theme" as documented in `botdocs/amys-theme.md`
- The configurations are designed to be portable across Arch Linux, Ubuntu, and WSL variants.
- WSL2 paths are included but won't cause errors on non-WSL systems
- SSH agent setup is sophisticated and handles both local and forwarded agents correctly
